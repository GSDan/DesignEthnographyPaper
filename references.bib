abstract = {HCI researchers are increasingly interested in describing the complexity of design
practice, including ethical, organizational, and societal concerns. Recent studies
have identified individual practitioners as key actors in driving the design process
and culture within their respective organizations, and we build upon these efforts
to reveal practitioner concerns regarding ethics on their own terms. In this paper,
we report on the results of an interview study with eleven UX practitioners, capturing
their experiences that highlight dimensions of design practice that impact ethical
awareness and action. Using a bottom-up thematic analysis, we identified five dimensions
of design complexity that influence ethical outcomes and span individual, collaborative,
and methodological framing of UX activity. Based on these findings, we propose a set
of implications for the creation of ethically-centered design methods that resonate
with this complexity and inform the education of future UX practitioners.},
