abstract = {HCI researchers are increasingly interested in describing the complexity of design
practice, including ethical, organizational, and societal concerns. Recent studies
have identified individual practitioners as key actors in driving the design process
and culture within their respective organizations, and we build upon these efforts
to reveal practitioner concerns regarding ethics on their own terms. In this paper,
we report on the results of an interview study with eleven UX practitioners, capturing
their experiences that highlight dimensions of design practice that impact ethical
awareness and action. Using a bottom-up thematic analysis, we identified five dimensions
of design complexity that influence ethical outcomes and span individual, collaborative,
and methodological framing of UX activity. Based on these findings, we propose a set
of implications for the creation of ethically-centered design methods that resonate
with this complexity and inform the education of future UX practitioners.},

abstract = {Abstract Until recently, most ethnographic research in information systems has been based on the traditional anthropological model of ethnography. In this traditional model of ethnography, one of the most important data-gathering techniques is participant observation. The ethnographer observes and participates but does not actively seek to change the situation. In recent years, however, a new type of ethnographic research has emerged – one that can be called design ethnography. Design ethnography is where the researcher goes beyond observation and actively engages with people in the field. Our view is that design ethnography has much potential for research in information systems. It is a new form of engaged scholarship that bridges the gap between ethnographic research and design science research.},
