\section{Context}

This project came about through a three-way partnership between: the research team---members of a HCI research group based in Australia; the Bangladeshi branch of an international NGO (anonymised as `\NGO{}'); and \PC{} (anonymised): a gig-economy startup company, based in Dhaka, Bangladesh (BD). Each party had their own motivations for taking part:

\NGO{} was in the midst of a project aiming to improve the well-being of women domestic workers in BD. Typically hired to cook, clean, do laundry or even care for the children of a household, domestic workers are increasingly common in BD: while there is no official data on the number of domestic workers in BD, estimates range between 2 million \cite{DWRN2011} and 4 million \cite{Ashraf2019}, with around 80\% being women or girls \cite{Ashraf2019}. Despite their prevalence, domestic work in BD was only recognised as an informal profession in 2015, with the introduction of the Domestic Workers Protection and Welfare Policy (DWPWP): prior to this, domestic workers were not entitled to time off, were not legally assured `fair' wages (85\% live under the poverty line \cite{BILS2015}), there were few restrictions on the hiring of children, and there were few legal protections from abuse and harassment within their places of work \cite{IDWF2015}. However, awareness of and adherence to these new policies has been inconsistent \cite{islam2016}, with a perceived lack of policy enforcement and reports of abuse still frequent \cite{DailyStar2018}. Within this context, \NGO{} aims to provide women domestic workers with skills training for formal job opportunities, to increase their awareness of their rights, and to support the BD government's capacity to enforce and monitor the implementation of the DWPWP. 

As in many other areas of the world, gig-economy platforms are increasingly common in BD \cite{Ahmed2020}. In-fitting with a prevalent trend of techno-solutionist social interventions within BD [CITE - Manika?], \NGO{} chose this as a sector through which to promote their agenda. To this end, \NGO{} partnered with the gig-economy startup \PC{}. Aiming to be the `Uber' of domestic workers, \PC{} runs an app-based service through which customers can request a domestic worker using their smartphone: either for work that day (referred to as `instant work'), or for bookings of multiple weeks in length (`package work'). In exchange for configuring their business towards the promotion of the DWPWP and the empowerment of domestic workers, \NGO{} are assisting \PC{} with the recruitment and training of several thousand domestic workers to support higher rates of pay. As such, \PC{}'s priority was to create a functional platform for this service, which would enable them to: i) meet commercial interests, and ii) empower domestic workers.

However, the vast majority of these workers lack access to smartphones: usually only having a `feature phone' which can place calls and send SMS (although many are illiterate, making SMS of limited value). As a result, the majority of \PC{}'s workforce are unable to directly interact with the digital infrastructure to respond to client requests. In response, \PC{} initially introduced `Local Guides': another more highly-educated tier of gig-economy workers who could read and had access to a smartphone, taking orders through the app to forward their details to domestic workers through phone calls. In late 2020, \PC{} decided to explore alternative, automated solutions to bridge the domestic workers with the digital infrastructure. One such solution was the creation of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system: an automated telephone-based system which can be interacted with by callers through button presses. As a research team with experience of IVR technologies and an existing relationship with \NGO{}, we offered consultation and advice during the design process of this new system in exchange for access to the project as a research context.
